# Adventureworks Data set Project:
In this project I created some polished data visualizations using code that I sourced from the publicly available adventureworks datasets through kaggle. Throughout this project I was aiming to further hone my SQL skills as well as to practice writing SQL queries that could be later used for data visualizations of the queries. 

# Main goals:
To better understand and practice using SQL on larger scale database. I was aiming to run queries that could be used to outline trends in the sales of the products by organizing them by a variety of different potential impacting factors. 

# Methodology:
Used duckdb as well as SQLite in order to run and execute the queries within the database. All of the code was written in R-studio to be able to have access to r in order to create the visualizations for the queries. I used ggplot to display graphically what the queries retrieved as a more effective way to convey the findings found from the queries.
